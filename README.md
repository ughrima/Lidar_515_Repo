# Project Overview
This project processes data from a bag file to compute pairwise distance matrices and validate them.

## Pipeline:
Bag File: [\[Download Link\]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XX4M-aB5aFtj7gPMJKVAeRICdEEAT-EG/view?usp=sharing)

Frame Extraction

Downsampling: downsample.py

Data Split: split.py (Train/Test)

Pairwise Distance Calculation: pairwise_matrices.py

Validation: validation.py (Matrices were incorrect, so Gromov computation is on hold)
